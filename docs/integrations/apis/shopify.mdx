## Overview

Our Shopify integration allows you to create triggers and tasks that interact with Shopify. Trigger jobs when events happen, like when a new product is added to a shop, or when an order is paid for, etc. You can also perform tasks like creating products, editing variants, getting information about an order, and a lot more.

## Installing the Shopify packages

To get started with our Shopify integration, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/shopify` packages. You can do this using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/shopify@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/shopify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/shopify@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

You can use Personal Access Tokens to authenticate with Shopify and get started with building custom apps.

### Personal Access Tokens

To create the tokens on Shopify, login and [follow the instructions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps#create-and-install-a-custom-app). The required scopes depend on the tasks you wish to perform and which webhooks you intend to receive. Webhooks will generally need read access to the respective Shopify resource.

Additionally, you will also have to provide your shop domain.

More information can be found [here](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#authenticated-access-scopes).

```ts my-job.ts
import { Shopify } from "@trigger.dev/shopify";

//create Shopify client using a token
const shopify = new Shopify({
  id: "shopify",
  adminAccessToken: process.env.SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  apiKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY!,
  apiSecretKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY!,
  hostName: process.env.SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN!,
});
...
```

## Triggers and Tasks

Once you have set up a Shopify client, you can use it to create triggers and tasks.
